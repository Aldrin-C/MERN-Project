# <Expense-Tracker>

## Description

A react application designed to store personal expense data and make it simple
to track while also presenting it in a visually striking chart ðŸ˜Š  

I wanted to create a project that would make keeping track of expenses more 
enjoyable than a boring spreadsheet. My primary motivation for this project 
is to learn to add features that I was unfamiliar with such as file upload and a d3 chart.
